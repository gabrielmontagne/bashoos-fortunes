[Autumn 1690]

Unchiku, a monk in Kyoto, had painted what seemed to be a selfportrait.
It was the picture of a monk with his face turned away.
He asked me to write a verse on it, so I wrote: 
‘You are over sixty years old, and I am nearing fifty.
Together in a dream, we present the form of dreams.
Here I add the words of one asleep:

kochira muke / ware mo sabishiki / aki no kure
[this-way turn / I also lonely / autumn’s evening]
turn around to me …
I too feel a loneliness
this autumn’s evening
