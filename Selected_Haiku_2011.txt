INTRODUCTION

In translating such poems into what I hope is a vibrant and persuasive
English, three features of Bashō’s original are worth exploring in a little
detail:

INTRODUCTION
syllabic rhythm
This new translation of two hundred haiku by Matsuo Bashō presents
many of the finest poems he ever wrote, from a collection of nearly a
thousand; and the translation builds upon the foundations established by
the version of his travelogue Oku no hosomichi (The Narrow Road to the
Deep North), which appeared on this site in 2004. The rendering of Oku
no hosomichi into English confronted, quite deliberately, a fundamental
question in literary translation: to what extent, if any, might it be possible
to translate from a language of which one had little or no knowledge?
Would it be simply impossible? Or would such a version have to rely
upon so many extraneous aids (other translations, commentaries,
dictionaries, grammars, thesaureses, native speakers, scholars) as to
drown any vibrant individual voice in what would essentially be the
translation of a grey collective? And if these supports were unavailable,
or lacking, would such a text inevitably have to be loose paraphrase or
imitation or re-composition because the richness and subtlety of the
original had not been grasped?
It is for individual readers to judge the successes and failures of that
avowedly experimental translation of Oku no hosomichi which appeared
four years ago. But the experiment is now developed further in this new
collection of Bashō’s haiku, selected from the nearly three decades of his
literary career. The term haiku, and its relationship to two closely
associated terms, hokku and haibun, are clarified in a separate section; but
here, the basic features of Bashō’s poems in this mode are worth
summarising briefly. They are very short, extraordinarily condensed and
concentrated poems, almost always following a tripartite 5-7-5 syllabic
pattern, and presenting a distilled moment of perception, very often of the
natural world but also sometimes of domestic or personal life. They
capture things in the unique moment of their happening or being,
celebrating their unequivocal ‘this-ness’. A frog leaps into a pond, a
water jar cracks in a freezing night, waves of heat shimmer about a paper
robe, a cricket chirps beneath a helmet, a night-heron cries in the
darkness: these moments are held frozen, immune to both easy
symbolisation and to the flow of time. The reality of their presentness is
absolute.
ii

as indicated above, Bashō’s haiku almost always follow a 5-7-5 syllabic
pattern; and there is often an assumption that this pattern can be easily
translated into a similar syllabic count in English. Yet, as David Landis
Barnhill has pointed out [see Further Reading], Japanese ‘syllables’ are
both shorter and more uniform than in English, most of them comprising
simply a consonant and a vowel. The acoustic world evoked by Bashō’s
haiku, as a result, has a simpler, more regular cadence because of the
similarity between each sound. A 5-7-5 syllabic pattern, moreover, is not
native to English poetry. The metrical units most common in English
verse are either of two or of three syllables, with an overwhelming
emphasis upon the two-syllabled iamb, a weak beat followed by a strong
beat ( ˆ ¯ ). It is not easy to see, at first sight, how such twos can be
readily reconciled with the fives and sevens of the original.
Possibly because of these difficulties, few contemporary translators try to
reproduce the exact 5-7-5 pattern in English. Some opt for 4-6-4 or 5-8-3
or 3-7-6, or any pattern where the second section is longer than the first
and third. Some do not worry even about relative length, making all three
sections the same, or the second actually shorter than the other two. Such
variations, however, have an arbitrary air about them, as if the form in
which Bashō is speaking is somehow marginal, rather than intrinsic, to
what he is saying. It is for this reason that the translation here retains the
5-7-5 syllabic pattern of the original, except on the very rare occasions
when Bashō himself varies the pattern, and the English follows his
variation. I have tried to sustain, rather than erode, the natural rhythms of
English in this syllabic fidelity; but only individual readers can determine
with what success.

lineation
it is not always realised that, in Japanese script, Bashō’s haiku are
presented, not as three horizontal separate lines, but as one continuous
vertical line, read from top to bottom. As a result, some translators have
suggested, his haiku should not be set in multiple lines, because pre-

iii

INTRODUCTION

modern Japanese poets had no concept of lineation as a poetic device.
And yet, as Makoto Ueda [see Further Reading] cogently argues,
to insist that a hokku should be a one-line poem in English because the
original Japanese poet had no sense of lineation is tantamount to insisting that
no English grammatical article, such as “a” or “the”, should be used in
translating Japanese sentences because the Japanese language includes no
concept of articles.

Moreover, even in the single continuous line, Japanese readers are aware
of the tripartite structuring embedded in it. It is for these reasons that I
have chosen to present the haiku in three distinct lines, but in an indented
and overlapping visual pattern, rather than a clean and straightforward
justification at a left-hand margin. The difference in impact between the
linear, almost military precision of
Autumn passing now.
Through the slow drizzling of rain,

and the more fluid connectedness of

INTRODUCTION

heard. Beginning a haiku with a capital letter and ending it with a full
stop suggests that the perception is contained solely and authoritatively
within the seventeen syllables of the poem. But in truth, Bashō’s haiku
begin long before the first syllable is uttered, just as they sound long after
the seventeenth syllable has been heard.

The two hundred haiku in this collection are presented chronologically,
from the earliest, composed in 1666, to the last haiku Bashō ever wrote,
in the autumn of 1694. Each poem is presented in a similar format:
the number in the sequence
the period of composition
a Romanised version of the Japanese characters
a completely literal rendering that follows the original
ordering of the Japanese words exactly
the final translation into English.
A typical presentation therefore looks like this:

autumn passing now …

the shape of the moon

[Summer 1689]

will be very apparent.

shizukasa ya / iwa ni shimiiru / semi no koe
[stillness! / rock into penetrate / cicada’s voice]

punctuation and capitalisation
in order to maintain the rhythmic flow and suggestiveness of Bashō’s
original, I have tried to punctuate as sparingly as possible, and then often
with marks such as the dash ( – ) or ellipses (…), rather than the more
widely used forms of comma, colon, semi-colon, full stop. All Bashō’s
haiku contain what is known as a kireji, or ‘cutting word’, which is often
indicated in English versions by an exclamation mark. Although I have
used this particular form of punctuation occasionally, it has generally
seemed too rhetorical and melodramatic in visual and emotional impact
for any broader application. The almost imperceptible pause of wonder
that the kireji signals is better represented by – or … .

the utter silence …
cutting through the very stone
a cicada’s rasp

Where Bashō gives a title or other explanatory material for a haiku, this is
presented after the period of composition. A NOTE against a line or word
indicates further discussion of a particular issue in translation, which can
be accessed by clicking on NOTE.

Similarly, the typographical device of capitalisation seems intrusive,
directing response rather than allowing the resonance of the original to be

INTRODUCTION

Where the versions of haiku presented four years ago in my translation of
Oku no hosomichi were lacking, I hope this new collection will have
remedied any faults. Where the earlier versions were successful, I hope I
have maintained their effectiveness here. Like any translator of Bashō, I
owe thanks to all those many predecessors who have done so much to
pave the way, a number of whom are listed in the Further Reading and
Links section. But I am particularly indebted to Makoto Ueda and David
Landis Barnhill for the word-for-word, literal renderings presented in
their editions, and without which, my advance would have been so much
more difficult.

CHRONOLOGY

he himself as ‘Master Bashō’, the pen name he adopts for the
rest of his life.

CHRONOLOGY

1644

1656

born in the town of Ueno, in Iga Province, some thirty miles
south-east of Kyoto. His father, Matsuo Yozaemon, is
probably a low-ranking samurai, but little is known about his
mother.
his father, who may have been in the service of a local
aristocratic family, the Tōdō, dies. Probably by this time,
Bashō is also in the service of the family. He develops a
close friendship with Tōdō Yoshitada, a boy two years older
than him who is already interested in poetry. The two receive
their first training in poetic composition together.

1662

composes his earliest known haiku.

1666

Tōdō Yoshitada dies suddenly in his twenty-fifth year – an
event that may have shocked Bashō so deeply that he
resigned from the service and embarked on a life of
wandering.

1666-71

no secure evidence about his whereabouts. He may have
gone to live in Kyoto, or only visited it occasionally. He
continues, however, to write: at least four poems in 1666,
thirty-two in 1667, six in 1669, two in 1670, three in 1671.

1682-3

in the winter of 1682, the Bashō hut burns down in a fire that
devastates large parts of Edo. Manages nevertheless to
supervise the first full-scale anthology of his school, now
comprising the work of over a hundred poets. His mother
dies, but he remains too poor to be able to travel to her
funeral. His students collect donations and provide him with
new accommodation.

1684

embarks on a journey that results in the first of his travel
narratives, The Journal of a Weatherbeaten Skeleton.

1686

composes what has since become the most famous of all
haiku, about a frog leaping into a pond.

1687

in the winter of 1686-7, meets Sora, a neighbour who is later
to become his companion in Oku no Hosomichi. Travels to
the lake country some fifty miles northeast of Edo, which
results in a short travel sketch, Kashima mōde (The
pilgrimage to Kashima Shrine). Compiles Atsume ku
(Collected verses), a collection of his work from the past
three years. Sets out on another journey to western Japan,
which results in Oi no kobumi (My knapsack notebook).

1688

continues to travel. Writes Sarashina kikō (The journal of
travel to Sarashina).

1689

undertakes the long northern journey which is to result in
Oku no Hosomichi. He leaves Edo in late spring and draws
his journey to a close in Ōgaki five months later, as autumn
begins to fall. He walks over twelve hundred miles. More
than four years are spent composing, revising and polishing
the final version.

1672

first goes to live in Edo (modern-day Tokyo), and in the next
six years becomes more and more known in literary circles,
writing haiku for anthologies, teaching, and judging poetry
competitions. A school of Bashō gradually comes into being.

1677-81

seems to have worked for a local waterworks company,
while continuing to gain recognition as a poet.

1690-91

continues to travel and to participate in haikai gatherings,
although he is plagued with ill health.

1681

his students build a small house for him in Edo, and plant a
bashō tree (a variety of banana tree) close by. It grows so
well that his house becomes known as ‘the Bashō hut’ and

1692

another Bashō hut is built for him by his supporters, and he
continues to participate in haikai gatherings.

CHRONOLOGY

1693

heartbroken at the death of his nephew Tōin, whom he has
cared for as a son since 1676. Closes the gate to his
residence and refuses to see people altogether, although he
later resumes normal social activities.

1694

begins planning another westward journey, although his
health is failing and he feels his end is drawing near. But he
sets out in early summer, carried on a litter. His illness
becomes increasingly critical, and in late autumn, on 28
November, he dies. He is just fifty.

A NOTE ON HOKKU, HAIKU, AND HAIBUN

A NOTE ON HOKKU, HAIKU, AND HAIBUN

Sarashina Journal, and The Narrow Road to the Deep
North, Bashō is revealed as the first great haibun writer,
juxtaposing prose and poetry to persuasive imaginative
effect.

It is worth clarifying briefly the similarities and differences between three
terms that readers will often meet in discussion of Bashō’s work: hokku,
haiku, and haibun.
hokku

historically, hokku evolved out of a favourite form of
fourteenth and fifteenth century Japanese poetry, known as
renga. Renga, literally meaning ‘linked poetry’, was a
sequence of short poems generally written by a team of
poets, and following prescribed metrical rules. The hokku,
literally meaning ‘opening verse’, was the first and most
important part of the sequence, since it prepared the ground
for everything that followed. Its syllabic pattern was 5–7–5.
Gradually, though, the close link between hokku and renga
became more tenuous, with hokku being increasingly
regarded as semi-independent, even self-contained verse, no
longer initiating a following sequence. This view gained
increasing force during the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries until the independence of hokku was established by
the writer Masaoka Shiki (1867-1902).

haiku

In order to distinguish it from earlier verse forms, Shiki gave
the name haiku to this short, independent verse form that
stood by itself, and that retained the earlier syllabic pattern
of 5–7–5. The name haiku became increasingly prevalent
during the twentieth century, and is now very widely used,
even though (in the case of Bashō’s work) it is
anachronistically applied. In the interests of accessibility and
intelligibility to a twenty-first century audience, however, I
use the term haiku (rather than hokku) throughout the
translation.

haibun

haibun is a kind of poetic-prose, and normally refers to a
relatively short piece of prose, punctuated by hokku. In his
Journal of Bleached Bones in a Field, Knapsack Notebook,

dreams. Here I add the words of one asleep:

At Kyokusui’s house

On the back wall of a Nō stage in Honma Shume’s house is a
picture of skeletons playing music and performing. Is human life any
different from this? Zhuangzi used to have a skull for his pillow, and
said he could not distinguish reality from dream. This truly evokes the
insubstantiality of our lives.

fields now withered all …

NOTES

NOTES
1

There is a play on words here. Yari can mean both ‘sliding door’ and
‘spear’; and kuchi means both ‘opening’ and ‘mouth’. I try to evoke
all four meanings in ‘through the opening of a door … / a cry
piercing through’. RETURN

2

Yo means a ‘joint [here, of bamboo]’ as well as ‘world’. Yo wa
sakasama is a common expression meaning ‘the world is upsidedown’ or ‘the world is topsy-turvy’. RETURN

3

4

Akanu means both ‘not open’ and also ‘not be tired of’. A ‘poem
bag’ was used to carry manuscripts of verse. RETURN
The phrase nami no hana refers to the caps of waves that look like
white blossoms. Kaeribana literally means ‘returning flower’, and
here refers to a flower that blooms out of season. RETURN

10 The first line of this haiku has, unusually, seven syllables, which are
duplicated in the translation. There are differing views about
whether the tub was outside (to wash in, to catch rainwater) or inside
(to stop a leak inundating the hut). RETURN
13 Bashō’s preface to this haiku provides the context of its creation:
‘That monk who’s wearing a hat and riding a horse, where has he
come from, and why is he wandering?’ ‘That,’ replied the painter, ‘is
a portrait of you on a journey.’ If that is the case, bumbling
horseman who roams the wide world, ‘take care you don’t fall from
the horse’. RETURN
17 A koto was a classical stringed instrument which, like music in
general, was said to have the power to make dust move. RETURN
25 The first line of this haiku has seven, rather than five, syllables. This
expansion is followed in the translation. RETURN
29 Bashō’s original text varies the syllabic count from 5/7/5 to 5/5/7.
This variation is copied in the translation. RETURN
31 Bashō’s original text presents a 5/5/5 syllabic pattern, rather than
5/7/5. This variation is followed in the translation. The adjective
‘frozen’ could also be applied to the monks, as well as to the implied
‘night’. RETURN

The term kari can indicate both ‘wild goose’ and ‘temporary’, a dual
meaning explained by the fact that wild geese are migrant birds,
leaving Japan in spring and returning in autumn. The first phrase
kumo to hedatsu has also been read as ‘separated by clouds’ or
‘beyond the clouds’. RETURN

50

6

Tsuki can mean ‘wine cup’ as well as ‘moon’, hence the apposition
of ‘this moon as wine-cup’. RETURN

7

A markedly irregular haiku, not only in its metre (the first line has
10 syllables rather than 5, the second 6 rather than 7), but also in its
unusual placing of the ‘cutting word’ ya in the last line. The phrase
ro no koe, too, may refer either to the sound the oar makes in the
oarlocks, or to the sound it makes as it dips into the water. The
version here follows the unusual syllabic pattern exactly, as well as
evoking both the sounds that the oar makes (‘the squeak of the oars
slapping on the waves’). RETURN

52 As Ueda [see Further Reading section] points out, ‘the word
horohoro is descriptive of thin and delicate things fluttering down
one after another, but it can also be used as onomatopoeia for a
pheasant’s cry.’ RETURN

5

70

A rare deviation from the attempt to preserve Bashō’s syllabic
count, with six syllables in the last line. RETURN

53 As Barnhill [see Further Reading section] argues, ‘the asunarō or
false cypress…looks like a hinoki cypress, a tree whose wood is
highly prized, while that of the false cypress is not. Literally,
asunarō means “tomorrow I will become”, and the context implies
“tomorrow I will become a cypress”. The asunarō seems to be what
it is not; it appears to fall short of what one might expect it to
achieve.’ RETURN

71

NOTES

64 The phrase tsuki no tomo has been interpreted as the moon being the
woman’s companion, but also as the woman’s image being Bashō’s
companion as he looks at the moon. RETURN
68 The term matsu means both ‘a pine’ and ‘to wait or look forward
to’; and Matsushima is a cluster of pine-clad islands famous for their
beauty. Both meanings of the word are contained in the line ‘on pine
island someone waits’. RETURN
70 Following the original kagerō no, the translated line contains four
syllables only. RETURN
115 The three syllables of the first line here follow the original tonbō ya.
RETURN

140 The ‘sixteenth-night moon’ occurs on 8 September (the sixteenth
night of the Eighth Month), a day after the harvest moon. RETURN
143 Shinobu means both ‘to remember’ and ‘to long for something’; and
shinobugusa is the hare’s foot fern, the fern of longing. RETURN
177 A ken is a measure of length, of about six feet. There is a continuing
debate about whether the rain is continuing to fall, or has stopped,
leaving the drops glistening in the tree. I incline to the former
interpretation, not least because raindrops on leaves would scarcely
be discernible at a height of forty to fifty feet. RETURN
182 The term yo can mean ‘life’ as well as ‘world’, and so the first line
could be equally well rendered as ‘journeying through life’. Kaku
means to plough a field of rice in preparation for transplanting. But
as Barnhill [see Further Reading] points out, the term also has two
homonyms, meaning ‘to write’ and ‘to paint’, which connect
agricultural work with artistic. RETURN

There are countless translations of Bashō’s haiku into English, from
numerous versions of individual haiku or small selections of them, to
larger and more comprehensive texts. Among the more widely ranging
editions are:

Several of the editions above present introductory comments about the
problems to be faced in any translation of Bashō’s haiku. By far the most
detailed and valuable exploration of those difficulties, though, is Mark
Jewel, ‘The Beat of Different Drummers: English Translations of Hokku
from Matsuo Basho’s Oku no hosomichi’, World Haiku Review, July
2002 [see also under Links section below]. Also of great interest is Mark
McGuinness, ‘Reading Bashō in the original’, in
www.wishfulthinking.co.uk/poetry/2006/04/28. This article explores the
different stages of translation presented in Toshiharu Oseko’s Bashō’s
Haiku [see above]. Despite extensive searching, however, Oseko’s edition
remains unavailable.

Links
Internet sites concerned with Bashō’s life and work, and especially with
haiku in general, are very numerous indeed. Searching simply for
‘Matsuo Bashō’ in Google, for example, currently (2007) yields over
150,000 references. For general studies and surveys of haiku, which often
